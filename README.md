How the Program Works:
1. Random Hole Distance: At the start, the program randomly sets the distance to the hole between 400 and 600 yards.
2. User Input for Swing Power: The user is asked to enter a power level for their swing, between 1 and 10.
3. Calculating Swing Distance: The swing distance is calculated as the swing power multiplied by a random number between 10 and 20, simulating variability in the swing effectiveness.
4. Game Progress: The program keeps track of the total number of swings and the distance covered.
5. Winning Condition: The game continues until the ball reaches or surpasses the hole distance.
Feel free to modify the program to include more features like wind resistance, different clubs, or a par system!
